# Keychron 
I recently bought a [Keychron K7 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k7-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard) mechanical keyboard and started
to configure the keymap for my usage. 

This repo will contain my layout JSON file, which I can easily load using the [Via App](https://usevia.app).
